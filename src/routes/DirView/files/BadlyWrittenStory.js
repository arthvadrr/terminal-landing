            "Lost at sea, eh?" the tavern's owner said, his face twisting into a grin. "Well, that's a new one, ain't it? What ship did you sail on, missy?"
            </p>
            <p>
            I blinked blearily. "What ship do you think I sailed on, sir? The Royal Anne?" I squinted up at him. "Do you know what a ship is?"The man stared back at me, his beard bristling with each parsec we put between us. "Aye, I know what a ship is. But what I don't know is why you're dressed like one of them. You're not one of them, are you?"
            </p>
            <p>
            The tavern owner chuckled. "Do I look like one of them? Oh, I'm sure you know what I mean. The buccaneers, the cutthroats. They wear cloaks and hoods to disguise themselves.

            </p>
            <p>
            I blinked at him, my eyes adjusting to the dim light. "Who watching me, sir? The townspeople? The guards? No one knows I'm here, except you, and you seem to be the only one who cares."<br/>
            "Aye, but they know you're here.That's why they're watching. Waiting for you to do something so they can arrest you. You're one step away from being caught, missy "Arrest me? For what crime, exactly?" I asked, leaning against the wall next to the door. "Stealing food from the poor? Harassing innocents for sport?
