                Sir,<br/>

            <p>
                Your order of 100,000 pounds of chicken feed - as amusing as it was - cannot be processed at this time - or ever. We are assuming that this order was placed by mistake, especially since in the <i>Special Instructions</i> field you specified that you were going to, "Cum pik er up in my chevy silver-ado" and "leeve a guud tip I got BUdweiser". Unless you plan on showing up with a fleet of 100 Silver-ado's - and please let us know if this is your plan - then this order cannot be placed at this time. Please be more aware of the order sizes when submitting orders from our system in the future. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you,<br/><br/>
